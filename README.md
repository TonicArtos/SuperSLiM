SuperSLiM is a configurable layout manager for a RecyclerView. It provides a vertical scrolling list of sections. Each section is a grouping of one or more views, arranged by a section layout manager (SLM). Sections may have a header, and each header can have its own unique layout. The SLM can be one of the provided (listed below), or of your own creation.

SuperSLiM also has a maintained [wiki](https://github.com/TonicArtos/SuperSLiM/wiki) with guides and documentation to help you out.

## Compatibility
Minimum sdk is presently set to 9. However, the library is only supported for, and actively tested against, versions 15 and later.

## Feature Overview
**Section Headers**

**Section Layout Managers (SLM)**  
- Linear (like ListView)
